# Challenges

## Description

This repository contains projects, challenges, and problems related to different areas of computer science and programming. The contents are organized into different directories, each serving a specific purpose.

## Directory Structure

- **AI Based Projects:** This directory contains Python scripts for various AI-related projects.
  - `DecisionTree.py`: Implementation of a decision tree algorithm.
  - `KMeansClustering.py`: Implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm.
  - `LinearReg.py`: Implementation of linear regression.
  - `NativeByesClassifer.py`: Implementation of a Naive Bayes classifier.
  - **NurelNetworks:** This subdirectory contains neural network implementations.
    - `AdvancedNetwork.py`: Implementation of an advanced neural network.
    - `MathBasedNuralNetwork.py`: Implementation of a math-based neural network.
    - `data.csv`: Dummy data for network training.

- **Challenges Written in C:** This directory contains C programs for various programming challenges.
  - **Dynamic Programming:**
    - `dp.c`: Dynamic programming solution to the fib sequence.
  - **HashTable:**
    - `hash.c`: Implementation of a hash table.

- **OOPS based:** This directory contains object-oriented programming examples.
  - `VendingMachine.py`: Example of a vending machine implemented using OOP principles.

- **Problems:** This directory contains Python scripts for solving programming problems.
  - `Anagrams.py`: Solution for an anagram-related problem.
  - `MissingNums.py`: Finding the missing number in a sorted array.
  - `PrefixTrie.py`: Implementation of a prefix trie data structure.
  - `RevLinkedList.py`: Solution for reversing a linked list.
  - `TSP.py`: Solution for the Traveling Salesman Problem.
  - `TwoSum.py`: Solution for the Two Sum problem.
  - `derivitive.py`: Solution for calculating derivatives of a test function.
  - `longestsubarr.py`: Solution for finding the longest subarray within a given array.

- **Project Ideas:** Still under work...

- **Robotics:** This directory contains the scripts I used to solve some robotics challenges presented to me.
